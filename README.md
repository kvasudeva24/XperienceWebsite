# Xperience Website

While working with my CS teacher at VHHS, there is a coding camp that he runs called Xperience Coding. It has been established for a few years now. One of the goals for this year was to make it its own nonprofit, registered with the state of Illinois and the federal government. One of the processes to do this was to create a website. I was tasked with making the website. The website is: https://xperiencecoding.github.io/xperiencecoding/ 

While still in the base stages, it has been very helpful in informing the community about who we are. The code is a GitHub repo where you can find at: https://github.com/xperiencecoding/xperiencecoding
